## Project Overview

This project analyzes nationwide access to gynecologic oncologists and other OBGYN subspecialists using drive time isochrones, demographic data, and geospatial analysis. The analysis examines how accessibility varies across different geographic areas, demographic groups, and time periods (2013-2023).

Using the HERE Maps API and census data, we calculate drive time isochrones around gynecologic oncologists' locations and analyze the demographics of populations within each drive time threshold. The project examines changes in accessibility over time and retirement patterns among specialists.

### Subspecialists Analyzed
- Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery/Urogynecology
- Gynecologic Oncology
- Maternal-Fetal Medicine
- Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility

## File Organization

#### Data Gathering
- `bespoke_functions.R` - Data for the duckDB connection and functions for the Data Gathering lettered code below.  The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) provides a cumulative NPI/NPPES dataset created from monthly CMS files spanning from April 2007 to the present, addressing limitations in official CMS offerings that lack historical provider details. The dataset is deduplicated based on variable changes (excluding mere updates in file names or years), and includes separate core and multiplicative variable files to manage the large file sizes efficiently.

| **Dataset/Script Name**                        | **Available Years**            | **Notes**                                                                                                       |
|:------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`A_nppes_download.R`**                        | 2007–2022                      | NBER cumulative NPPES file (monthly updates deduplicated; includes changes back to 2007).                      |
| **`A-NPI_deactivation_download.R`**             | Varies, slightly delayed       | Based on self-reported deactivation. CMS updates irregularly; may lag real-time by 1–2 years.                  |
| **`A-Medicare_part_d_prescribers_data_downloaded`** | 2013–2022                  | Released annually by CMS; first available dataset based on 2013 prescribing data.                              |
| **`A-download_physician_compare_download`**     | ~2013–2020 (downloaded files)  | ICPSR archive has files through ~2020 (Physician Compare closed in Dec 2020). Must manually log in.            |
| **`A-facility_affiliation_download.R`**         | 2014–present                   | First Facility Affiliation data started ~2014; yearly updates (CMS Physician Compare Affiliation data).        |
| **`A-open_payments_download.R`**                | 2013–present                   | Open Payments (Sunshine Act) started reporting payments in 2013. Annual updates.                               |


- `A_nppes_download.R` - Downloads NPPES data for back years from NBER (National Board Economic Research).  The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) provides a cumulative NPI/NPPES dataset created from monthly CMS files spanning from April 2007 to 2022, addressing limitations in official CMS offerings that lack historical provider details. The dataset is deduplicated based on variable changes (excluding mere updates in file names or years), and includes separate core and multiplicative variable files to manage the large file sizes efficiently.

- `A-NPI_deactivation_download.R` - NPPES data may be a few years behind and is all based on personal report.  

- `A-Medicare_part_d_prescribers_data_downloaded` - Good for docs who prescribe drugs to Medicare patients over 65 years old.  Started 2013 to 2022.  

- `A-download_physician_compare_download` - To get old physician compare/national downloadable files we need to log in manually to OPEN ICPSR:  https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/149961/version/V1/view?path=/openicpsr/149961/fcr:versions/V1&type=project.  You have to login with google account to download it.  

- `A-facility_affiliation_download.R` - Gold standard.  

- `A-open_payments_download.R` - Open Payments.  

- `B-read_in_csv_file_to_duckDB_database.R` -  Reads in the NPPES CSV fils from the NBER to the duckDB database.  The primary action occurs via the process_nppes_data function (defined in an external script bespoke_functions.R), which reads and processes a large CSV file containing historical NPI data (spanning May 2005 to October 2020). The processed data is stored in a DuckDB database file. 

- `C-Extracting_and_Processing_NPPES_Provider_Data.R` - Function for processing OBGYNs from NPPES data with exact file names for years 2010 to 2022.  Automatically identifies and maps database tables to their corresponding years, enabling efficient extraction of provider data across different time periods.  Specifies taxonomy codes representing various OB/GYN subspecialties, including general obstetrics and gynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, and female pelvic medicine. Looks at all taxonomy columns in each year's dataset (not just the first one).  Checks if any of your specified codes appear in any of those columns.  Includes a physician in the results if there's a match in any column.  Retrieves provider records matching specified OB/GYN taxonomy codes from each year, standardizing and combining the data into a unified dataset.

```r
# These codes identify different specialties within obstetrics and gynecology
obgyn_taxonomy_codes <- c(
  "207V00000X",    # Obstetrics & Gynecology
  "207VX0201X",    # Gynecologic Oncology
  "207VE0102X",    # Reproductive Endocrinology
  "207VG0400X",    # Gynecology
  "207VM0101X",    # Maternal & Fetal Medicine
  "207VF0040X",    # Female Pelvic Medicine
  "207VB0002X",    # Bariatric Medicine
  "207VC0200X",    # Critical care medicine
  "207VC0040X", 
  "207VC0300X",    # Complex family planning
  "207VH0002X",    # Palliative care
  "207VX0000X"     # Obstetrics only
)
```

- `D-Quality_check_on_NPPES_merge.R` - The check_physician_presence function is a well-designed utility for tracking physicians across temporal data. It efficiently analyzes a dataset containing physician information to determine when specific providers appear in the records. The function accepts a list of National Provider Identifiers (NPIs), optionally paired with provider names, and methodically examines each NPI's presence throughout different years. It returns a structured data frame summarizing each provider's representation in the dataset, including their total record count and a chronological listing of years in which they appear. This function is particularly valuable for longitudinal analyses of healthcare provider data, enabling researchers to identify patterns in physician presence, track career trajectories, or validate data completeness across multiple years of NPI records.

```r
# List of NPIs to check
npi_list <- c(
  "1689603763",   # Tyler Muffly, MD
  "1528060639",   # John Curtin, MD
  "1346355807",   # Pedro Miranda, MD

- `E-Medicare_part_d_prescribers_data_processing.R` - This script processes Medicare Part D prescribing data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Process each table filtering "Prscrbr_Type" only OBGYN and "Gynecological Oncology".  It identifies providers' prescribing patterns, cleans data by removing outlier records (claim counts over 50,000), annotates records by year, and merges multiple years into a single standardized dataset. Additionally, it calculates the last consecutive year each provider actively prescribed medications under Medicare Part D, facilitating analysis of provider activity and continuity over time.  NOT GOOD FOR DOCS WHO DO NOT TREAT PATIENTS >65 years old.  

- `F-retirement_year_confirmation.R` - Download the massive data files to the external hard drive for this with one set of code then then can run E-retirement_year_confirmation.R.  

Retirement Year Data download:
`NPPES_deactivated_download.R` - Best source but may be late.  
`Medicare_part_d_prescribers_data_processing` - People who prescribed to >65 year old women.  
`download_physician_compare_data.R` - Includes data for people who see Medicare.  
facility affiliation. - Does not include a year for the facility affiliation so it is not helpful.  
ABMS - scraped.  

- `getting_isochrones_trying.R` - Alternative method for isochrone generation
- `retirement_adjusted.R` - Enhanced retirement analysis using multiple data sources (NPI deactivation, Medicare data, and board certification status) to improve workforce accuracy.
- `subspecialists over time.R` - Analysis of subspecialist trends
- `visualize_fips_inters_isochr.R` - Visualizes FIPS code intersections
- `fips_blocks_female_proportion.R` - Analyzes female population in FIPS blocks
- `fips_isochrones_population_intersect.R` - Examines population within isochrones
- `zzzPostico.R` - Used Postico originally.  Able to use duckDB later on.  
- `Postico_database_pull.R` - Extracts physician data from PostgreSQL database, enabling year-by-year analysis of physician practice locations from 2013 to 2022.  Pulls "GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY" from the Primary Specialty.  For urogyn, we will need NPIs to go retrospectively to look for people.
